# DTMF_Shield
The Arduino DTMF Shield and software to program a Kenwood TM-742 series radio

This consists of:
1) an Arduino Sketch called DTMF_Shield, which runs on an Arduino Uno
2) an Arduino shield, called 'DTMF_Shield', that generates DTMF tones and otherwise emulates a Kenwood MC-45DM microphone or equivalent
3) a Visual Studio VB.Net application that, using a DTMF Shield on an Arduino, will program a Kenwood TM-742 series radio
